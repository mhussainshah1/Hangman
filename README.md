### Simple Hangman
You are going to write a word guessing game app in Java. This game is a simpler version of Hangman.

**Requirements:**

Initialize your array list with the following words: 
* tree
* rain
* bear
* encourage
* promise
* soup
* chess
* insurance
* pancakes
* stream
- When you run the application, randomly choose a word from that list for the user to guess.
- For each letter the user guesses wrong, let them know along with how many wrong guesses they have left.
- The user is allowed up to 5 wrong guesses. On the 6th wrong guess, they lose the game.
- If the user guesses correctly, output the word with the letters they have guessed correctly so far and blanks for letters they have not guessed yet.
- The user can input either a letter or a word for their guess.
- If the user guesses the word correctly, output "You've won!" and end the game.

Sample output:

```
Welcome, let's play hangman!

Here is the word I am thinking of: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

Enter your guess: a
Your guess so far: a _ _ a _ _ _ _ _ 

Enter your guess: e

Your guess so far: a _ _ a _ _ _ _ _

Enter your guess: arraylist

You've won! The word was arraylist. 

Thank you for playing!
